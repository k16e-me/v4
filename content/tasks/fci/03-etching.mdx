        body: |
            - Letter "Ficus" by testing and choosing a suitable display font
            - Potentially choose a suitable body font (may serve "print" design only as web may possibly stick with matching system font stack for performance)
            - Sketch and create the most suitable symbol metaphor based on the brand narrative. This will be potentially the dominant brand element.
            - Color Ficus by selecting and adjusting a fitting color scheme.
            - Create preliminary brand elements, potential patterns as emanate from brand trials
            - Complete brand manual (creating more brand elements as needed)
