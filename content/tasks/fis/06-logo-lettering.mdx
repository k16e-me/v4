            - Sketch various ideas of what a potential representative sign or symbol for FarmTech might be.
            - Select two or three of the best ideas and assign a keyword to each one. Each keyword/idea should hold a potential full story that can slot into the bigger FarmTech personality and story.
            - Test FarmTech (now Farmtech) against the complete gamut of types -- sans serif and serif -- and select the type that gels with the personality of the brand.
            - Determine keywords to describe how overall the type should make one feel with Farmtech written with it, and then inscribed/stylelized.
            - Choose one type, study, decide suitable case, study much closer.
            - Line up Farmtech with one or two already accepted good lettering design, square side-by-side, and fully justify the choice of type, weight (eventually stroke when vectorized)
