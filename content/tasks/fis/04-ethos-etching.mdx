            - The first question to answer here is, what should define the ethos of a brand? That is, what should be the basis of the brand's personality? As in, where should the brand "draw its person from", so to speak?
            - The activity here then is, well, you have no where else to look but into what's already been written -- if FarmTech should fulfill a defined purpose and pioneer a category, who or what should it be to do so effectively?
