    We want to be able to design everything, anything. As long as *our* touch can make it better, can transform it, and can improve lives, we want to design *that* thing.

    We can design a better spoon. We can design traffic—vehicular, human, even non-human. We can design sleep. We can design community...

    Because design sells *everything*! We can design *anything*.

    Our current focus includes brand design, responsive websites, progressive web applications, mobile apps, and web application frontends (mostly for SaaS products). But as we grow, we want to attract specialists in various fields to become consultants with us, using our [principles](https://gdi.k16e.co) and tastes to design everything.

    title="What drives us"
    image={ { filename: kb, alt: 'Kabolobari Benakole', caption: 'Kabolobari Benakole, kb at Lufasi Park, Abijo where he loves to decompress.', orientation: 'profile' } }>
    Our edge and core strength have come from a unique “eye” on design possessed first by Kabolobari Benakole, kb and actively shared by every founding member.

    This keen eye, profound empathy, and a deliberate depth of study and practice of the art and science of design, of everything, have all led us to develop an in-house methodology to design anything.

    Our methodology is called Pentacle (formerly Mothership), a stepwise pentagonal process that we apply to design anything, anything at all. Pentacle, as in five (5), has nothing to do with ["lucky charm"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentacle) -- design isn't magic or miracle, but a logical ordering of things to correspond sensibly (close enough) to how these might be experienced in order to delight.

    *(Documentation for Pentacle is in progress, and will be published on the website soon. Stay tuned. Actually, [keep checking.](/blog/pentacle))*
