    We want to be able to design everything, anything. As long as *our* touch can make it better, can transform it, and can improve lives, we want to design *that* thing.

    We can design a better spoon. We can design trafficâ€”vehicular, human, even non-human. We can design sleep. We can design community...

    Because design sells *everything*! We can design *anything*.

    Our current focus includes brand design, responsive websites, progressive web applications, mobile apps, and web application frontends (mostly for SaaS products). But as we grow, we want to attract specialists in various fields to become consultants with us, using our [principles](https://gdi.k16e.co) and tastes to design everything.
