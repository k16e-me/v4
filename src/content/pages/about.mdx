<BlockText title="Our Vision">
    We want to be able to design everything, anything. As long as *our* touch can make it better, can transform it, and can improve lives, we want to design *that* thing.

    We can design a better spoon. We can design trafficâ€”vehicular, human, even non-human. We can design sleep. We can design community...

    Because design sells *everything*! We can design *anything*.
