    Pentacle is K16E’s in-house product design methodology.

    It’s a stepwise pentagonal process applied to design anything, *anything at all.*

    Pentacle helps us at K16E to make everything satisfy all [characterizing marks of a good design](https://gdi.k16e.co/) so that not only are [our work](/work) exciting, memorable, and desirable, but are also, and most importantly, purposeful and profitable.

    What follows is a series of notes that document Pentacle in detail -- the steps, expected results from each, and the number of actions (or sub-steps) to be taken to reach expected results desirably.
