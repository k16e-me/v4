    Pentacle is K16Eâ€™s in-house product design methodology, a stepwise pentagonal process applied to design anything, *anything at all.*

    Pentacle helps us at K16E to make everything satisfy all [characterizing marks of good design](https://gdi.k16e.co/) so that not only are [our work](/work) exciting, memorable, and desirable, but also, most importantly, purposeful, profitable.

    What follows is a series of notes that document Pentacle in detail -- the steps, expected results from each, and the number of actions (or sub-steps) to be taken to reach expected results desirably.
