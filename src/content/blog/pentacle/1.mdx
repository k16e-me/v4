title: "Method or Tool?"
description: |
    Pentacle is still a methodology. But can the tools helping to deliver the results of each step be in one place? What if Pentacle is also the tool?
excerpt: |
    Our methodology is called Pentacle (formerly Mothership), a stepwise pentagonal process that we apply to design anything, anything at all. Pentacle as in five (5), nothing to do with "lucky charm" -- design isn't magic, but a logical ordering of things to correspond sensibly (close enough) to how they're to be experieced in order to delight.
