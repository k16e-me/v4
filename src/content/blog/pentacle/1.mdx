title: "Structure: Making Astro Make Sense"
description: |
    K16E is a collective of Global Good Designâ„¢ Consultants founded by Kabolobari Benakole.
excerpt: |
    Our methodology is called Pentacle (formerly Mothership), a stepwise pentagonal process that we apply to design anything, anything at all. Pentacle as in five (5), nothing to do with "lucky charm" -- design isn't magic, but a logical ordering of things to correspond sensibly (close enough) to how they're to be experieced in order to delight.
