title: "Methodology or Tool?"
description: |
    Pentacle is still a methodology. But can the tools helping to deliver the results of each step be in one place? What if Pentacle is also the tool?
excerpt: |
    Pentacle started and works excellently as a methodology. But it should equally be a tool, a complete system for design work. What would that tool look like? This is our first look into what Pentacle may look and be like as a digital visual product design tool — the design of the design.

Pentacle answers the question, “if you were handed a piece of idea to build, where would you start (as far as designing this thing is concerned)?”

The four core actual design work arms of the methodology have been so put to the test, we couldn’t be more positive of their delivery. Namely, *brainstorm, map, wireflow*, and *prototype*, these four prongs always address every activity of design that produces something of value — with a great starting point (brainstorm) and the best place for design to begin dialing back its direct involvement (prototype).

And when “engineering” kicks in, design then plays a fringe but supervisory guidance role to ensure what is built matches what was conceived and the experience expected (or defined) of the thing to deliver on its good.

### The Essence of Pentacle
As a practice, the foregoing already captures Pentacle. And in our application thus far (and for who knows how long until the idea of this note is viable), we have had to gather a number of tools suitable for the jobs defined at each stage of the pentagonal.

But what if Pentacle was a complete system, as in one tool that allows for the practice of the methodology and the design of the process (or processes)? This would be like an assembly line (in any manufacturing setup, the automobile being a classic example).

The goal of this note is to establish that desire — Pentacle started and works excellently as a methodology. But it should equally be a tool, a complete system for design work. What would that tool look like?
