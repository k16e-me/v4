title: Pentacle, at a glance
description: |
    What is Pentacle? What are its 5 prongs? What do they produce? Thus, what's Pentacle achieve for every product? Let's answer in this overview piece.
excerpt: |
    Pentacle is the pentagonal process that K16E consultants follow to design products, projects, or ventures that deliver a client's needs as well as satisfy the characterizing marks of good design. Let's look at the process' five prongs, what they are, and their outcomes toward the overall product objective(s).

### Baseline assumptions
To get started documenting Pentacle, let's get some baseline assumptions out of the way.

1. We define each prong in terms of its outcomes, especially which one of these outcomes we might judge to be the most crucial.
2. For the sake of moving the discussion on quickly without "or's" and "/'s" (say that out loud), we call everything "product" - namely product, project, service, venture, etc.

### The pentagonal
1. Brainstorm
2. Map
3. Wireflow
4. Prototype
5. Engineer

### Brainstorm
#### Definition
Brainstorm is a coordinated set of activities toward establishing a *product charter*.

A product charter is a single source of truth of the product, defining its goals and boundaries. While some parts of *charter* may be updated as the product progresses, most of it, especially its goals should ideally be almost carved in stone. This way, the product team doesn't stray.

Any change to the product's goals might actually mean a new direction, that is, a new product, entirely. Any such drastic changes to the charter must be carefully weighed.

A successful product is a testament to a successful charter, a successful Brainstorm.

#### Outcomes
1. Possible solutions to build
2. High-level concept of product,
3. Creative brief
4. User personas
5. Empathy maps, and
6. Product Charter

#### Actions
