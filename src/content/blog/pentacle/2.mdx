title: Pentacle, at a glance
description: |
    What is Pentacle? What are its 5 prongs? What do they produce? Thus, what's Pentacle achieve for every product? Let's answer in this overview piece.
excerpt: |
    Pentacle is the pentagonal process that K16E consultants follow to design products, projects, or ventures that deliver a client's needs as well as satisfy the characterizing marks of good design. Let's look at the process' five prongs, what they are, and their outcomes toward the overall product objective(s).

### Baseline assumptions
To get started documenting Pentacle, let's get some baseline assumptions out of the way.

1. We define each prong in terms of its outcomes, especially which one of these outcomes we might judge to be the most crucial.
2. For the sake of moving the discussion on quickly without "or's" and "/'s" (say that out loud), we call everything "product" - namely product, project, service, venture, etc.
3. You might encounter the term "product commissioner" and wonder "what now, a new role?" We could've just spoken of a "product manager", no? Well, the idea of a commissioner is to be not so specific as to who may have the most emotional ownership of the product, and can be the one who "commissions" it, who's in charge of it, but not necessarily the traditional role of a product manager.

### The pentagonal
1. Brainstorm
2. Map
3. Wireflow
4. Prototype
5. Engineer

### Brainstorm
#### Definition
Brainstorm is a coordinated set of activities toward establishing a *product charter*.

A product charter is a single source of truth of the product, defining its goals and boundaries. While some parts of *charter* may be updated as the product progresses, most of it, especially its goals should ideally be almost carved in stone. This way, the product team doesn't stray.

Any change to the product's goals might actually mean a new direction, that is, a new product, entirely. Any such drastic changes to the charter must be carefully weighed.

A successful product is a testament to a successful charter, a successful Brainstorm.

#### Outcomes
1. Possible solutions to build
2. High-level concept of product,
3. Creative brief
4. User personas
5. Empathy maps, and
6. Product Charter

#### Actions

1. Generate constraints-free definitions of idea or ideas from creative brief (if available). Think of this point as “wilding” or mind-mapping of ideas, letting yourself dream them up wild. A creative brief might emerge, which you’ll eventually test against the potential users of product. Really, a Creative Brief should emerge, either as improvement on one from the product commissioner or as deduced from this exercise.

2. Jot a list of features or solutions (or ramifications/implications of feature) to idea or ideas given in creative brief. What might product commissioner be desiring?

3. Access research or conduct new studies into knowing if the problem truly exists for which the creative brief is asking a solution. At this point, assess and answer a few ethical principles that may be applicable to product. Ask and document hard-hitting questions about the process for designing this product, and ethical issues that may arise from designing the product itself.

4. Empathize with potential users of possible solutions from the brainstorm and creative brief. User personas may be created at this point. In creating personas, attempt to address more of the issues raised in the step above. Let your answers begin to prescribe what sort of design choices might resolve such issues if/when they do arise.

5. Has or have these solutions been built already? What about these existing ones? What might we do differently? Why'd they make the obvious decisions?

6. Who's behind the creative brief? What's this person/company like? What might delight them? Asking of product commissioner, see?

### Map
#### Definition
Map represents the drafting, drawing, connecting, refining, and finalizing what will be the scope of what is to be built, the product.

A "Versioning" or scope document should wrap up the map phase and may either fully encapsulate its different outcomes or point to them (where they may be housed in their own separate documents).

#### Outcomes
1. Validated Product Hypothesis (VPH)
2. Information Architectures (IA’s)
3. User flows
4. Navigation Design (ND),
5. Brand & Copy, and
6. Versioning (product scope document)
