title: A 7-step digital development workflow (7SD)
description: |
    Pentacle is still a methodology. But can the tools helping to deliver the results of each step be in one place? What if Pentacle is also the tool?
excerpt: |
    7-Step Digital (or 7SD) "the 7-step digital development workflow" we follow in making digital products such as websites, apps, SaaS (web) apps, brands, etc is exactly what its title suggests -- a 7-step rubric. Like a mini Pentacle, we hold it against the wall as we undertake a project, seeing one to the finish-line.

### Baseline Assumptions
1. We speak of "client" (the one to report to) and "contractor" (like K16E handling the website)
2. We approximate the product or project as "website" since 7SD was really born off K16E's website projects, where we tend to have a greater amount of client-contractor interactions and task assignments
3. We have chosen to call the rubric and its graphic 7SD

### Purpose
Client should document a purpose for the website. Purpose can then be followed up with a set of goals that client hopes to achieve.

From the very kick-off meeting, establishing Purpose, Pu should be #1 priority, and neither contractor nor client should proceed to anything else till a clear purpose and achievable set of goals are documented and signed-off on. If we know what we're building we must equally agree on and easily articulate why we're building it.

Before you can establish the journeys you think or know or want or expect people to take to get to their desired destination with your website, these journeys have to be anchored on your purpose and goals, your expectations. Because how else would you measure success?

Purpose, Pu falls into the non-intersecting set in 7SD with 100% responsibility of creating it on client. While contractor can help here, this is really the client's time to shine, to show that they know what they're asking for.

#### Discussions
1. When to have a Purpose, Pu conversation?
2. How to have a Purpose, Pu conversation and how and where should Purpose, Pu be documented and archived for shared reference?
3. Can the Purpose of the website change midway or at some point during or after development? If yes, how should that affect the process or outcome?
4. How do you state and make sense of Purpose, Pu? What all is involved in doing so?
5. Can Purpose, Pu be framed as/like a "problem statement", describing what needs to be addressed, and possibly followed with some "value proposition", establishing to potential users why they would/should need the website?
6. Can Purpose, Pu self-point and define in itself what would be a measure of success or effectiveness? By how much?
