title: A 7-step digital development workflow (7SD)
description: |
    Pentacle is still a methodology. But can the tools helping to deliver the results of each step be in one place? What if Pentacle is also the tool?
excerpt: |
    7-Step Digital (or 7SD) "the 7-step digital development workflow" we follow in making digital products such as websites, apps, SaaS (web) apps, brands, etc is exactly what its title suggests -- a 7-step rubric. Like a mini Pentacle, we hold it against the wall as we undertake a project, seeing one to the finish-line.

### The Flow
1. Purpose, Pu
2. Journeys, Jo
3. Structure, St
4. Content, Co
5. Visualizations, Vi
6. Assembly, As
7. Upkeep, Up

![7SD rubric as used at K16E for making digital products such as websites, apps, SaaS (web) applications, brands, etc. Review article to see the order of application.](@uploads/workflows/workflows-digital-7-steps.png)

### Baseline Assumptions
1. We speak of "client" (the one to report to) and "contractor" (like K16E handling the website)
2. We approximate the product or project as "website" since 7SD was really born off K16E's website projects, where we tend to have a greater amount of client-contractor interactions and task assignments
3. We have chosen to call the rubric and its graphic 7SD

### Purpose
Client should document a purpose for the website. Purpose can then be followed up with a set of goals that client hopes to achieve.

From the very kick-off meeting, establishing Purpose, Pu should be #1 priority, and neither contractor nor client should proceed to anything else till a clear purpose and achievable set of goals are documented and signed-off on. If we know what we're building we must equally agree on and easily articulate why we're building it.

Before you can establish the journeys you think or know or want or expect people to take to get to their desired destination with your website, these journeys have to be anchored on your purpose and goals, your expectations. Because how else would you measure success?

Purpose, Pu falls into the non-intersecting set in 7SD with 100% responsibility of creating it on client. While contractor can help here, this is really the client's time to shine, to show that they know what they're asking for.

#### Discussions
1. When to have a Purpose, Pu conversation?
2. How to have a Purpose, Pu conversation and how and where should Purpose, Pu be documented and archived for shared reference?
3. Can the Purpose of the website change midway or at some point during or after development? If yes, how should that affect the process or outcome?
4. How do you state and make sense of Purpose, Pu? What all is involved in doing so?
5. Can Purpose, Pu be framed as/like a "problem statement", describing what needs to be addressed, and possibly followed with some "value proposition", establishing to potential users why they would/should need the website?
6. Can Purpose, Pu self-point and define in itself what would be a measure of success or effectiveness? By how much?

### Journeys
If the question of what you want people to do as well as why is answered, the very next one is how do you want them to get there, to your purpose, on the website? Where might visitors be coming from? Where might they land first? What should they see first? How should they interact with the website?

Then what, where? Where should they go next? How would you get them there, how might they get there (by you leading them or as self-directed) and eventually to take the action you desire them to? These are journey questions, which we need to establish, to delineate.

Journeys, Jo start out as guesses or preliminary interpretations from data (or findings) that the client has about their product or company. They're very predictive in nature but can be accurate, if Client (or Contractor) has good knowledge of the users. Eventually, when the project has been live, analytics data can help make these journeys even more scientific, as insights will have been gained â€” (a case of Upkeep, Up interplaying with Journeys, Jo). But even before analytics data starts filtering through, some clear and easy to reason about journeys for the design must be established.

Sections of pages and the pages themselves emanate from a grasp of these journeys. Even manners of design during Visualizations, Vi may be dictated by Journeys, Jo. So, delineating journeys is equally as important as documenting purpose(s) and goals.

Journeys, Jo falls in the non-intersecting set of 7SD with responsibility fully on client. Client can be assisted by contractor. But in the case where client waves responsibility, contractor has an opportunity to reflect it in their contract/billing.

#### Discussions
1. How much should be involved in the delineation of "user" journeys?
2. How detailed should Journeys, Jo be? Detail can be tested in terms of multiples of user flows drawn (a tangible UX deliverable or artifact [if activity is guided by Contractor]).
3. Can and how can journeys be tested?
4. Can Journeys, Jo expose a possible folly in Purpose, Po? If so, should Purpose, Po be redone or both steps invalidated and thoroughly reviewed?
5. How can Client or Contractor avoid "designer bias" in doing Journeys, Jo since the website is yet to be done at this point and tested with real users?
6. How much consideration to accessibility (including a good range of users with disability) should be made while doing Journeys, Jo?
7. Is there a rubric to score a user journey at this stage? How do we know when/if a map of such journey(s) is sufficient?

It's worth noting that user journeys here may be based mainly on assumptions about the intended website. However, such assumptions would closely approximate reality eventually if some secondary research is done (into how things might look with similar website) before they're concluded on. It's also possible to conduct surveys in order to gather quantitative findings about some of these understood journeys.
