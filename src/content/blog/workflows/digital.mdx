title: A 7-step digital development workflow (7SD)
description: |
    Pentacle is still a methodology. But can the tools helping to deliver the results of each step be in one place? What if Pentacle is also the tool?
excerpt: |
    7-Step Digital (or 7SD) "the 7-step digital development workflow" we follow in making digital products such as websites, apps, SaaS (web) apps, brands, etc is exactly what its title suggests -- a 7-step rubric. Like a mini Pentacle, we hold it against the wall as we undertake a project, seeing one to the finish-line.

### Baseline Assumptions
1. We speak of "client" (the one to report to) and "contractor" (like K16E handling the website)
2. We approximate the product or project as "website" since 7SD was really born off K16E's website projects, where we tend to have a greater amount of client-contractor interactions and task assignments
3. We have chosen to call the rubric and its graphic 7SD
