    This piece of note will start first as just a dump of some keywords that used individually or as a combo might work well as component names (especially) in programming. Eventually, as the comma-separated words grow, I might re-organize the whole dump as a dictionary (of sort).

It is true naming is the hardest thing to do in, er... programming? How about in *everything*? I wouldn't hesitate to admit. Yeah? But can it be any easier? What if we had a dictionary of possibles? Let me propose some...

> bullhorn, business brief, entrance, entry,  fallback, front-door, gatekeeper, offerings, piece, signpost, slideshow, slow reveal, snapshot, tagline, topfold,

### Where could dictionary be handy?
I was just about to type "programming" then realized that, of course, draws on design - naming components. You got to be able to name something something that makes sense, first to you, and then to others who might encounter (or use) your design, your code, even to peers who may pick up after or collaborate with you. Even to future you (when you might revisit what you designed sometime).

### Qualities of a good component name? Of a dictionary entry
1. **Meaningful, but not (too) specific.**

    While it should make sense to you (and anyone looking in), it shouldn't be too specific to what it is describing, too literal. Should be kind of blank, and so it can travel from application to application. It should rather describe the action of the thing, the behavior of, than the thing itself. Yet again, not too blank.

    "Carousel" seems too literal for what designers/developers tend to use it to name. And yet, "slider" is *way* too blank, and almost meaningless for that kind of thing. "Slideshow" (or "gallery") may be more appropriate for that.

### A possibility with dictionary
No, I'm not sitting down at once, not any time necessarily to come up with these possibles, but as I work, study, or just at random, one pops and I drop it here. At some point, I see myself transforming this dictionary into actually defining how I imagine some of these words may be used, what sort of components might they be suitable for, yes, possibilities.
