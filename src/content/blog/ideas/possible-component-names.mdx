It's true naming is the hardest thing to do in programming. How about in everything? I wouldn't hesitate to admit. But can it be any easier? What if we had a dictionary of possibles? Let me propose some...

> business brief, entrance,  fallback, front-door, gatekeeper, offerings, signpost, slow reveal, snapshot, tagline, topfold,
