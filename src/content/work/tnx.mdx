    How do you present a new real estate company out of Lagos, Nigeria that wants to change how real estate is priced, sold, and procured both for the local industry and, of course, as the model would eventually propagate, the global real property market?

    Specifically, this company -- Turnix, as kb named it, which name became the winner -- was formed from the pain the founder himself had suffered when he bought his first home. O. Ojemakinde went on resolved to change the face and reputation of real estate for good. His company would be a model, perhaps first of its kind to offer "true turnkey real estates", letting anyone anywhere buy property like they can a piece of fruit from the local market.

    Gone would be opaque terms and conditions from landlords or brokers, middlemen, agents snagging 10% here 10% there, endless "inspections" and visitations to non-existent properties,  undisclosed spurious fees, "let's just hope and pray it goes well", and many more troubles with acquiring real property.

    Turnix would equip buyers, sellers, and residents with research and tools to own what real property suits their needs -- no gimmicks, no excuses, no stories that touch.

    K16E has created a stunning identity for Turnix that gives this new brand the best representation for its ambitious mission and a fondness among its customers.
