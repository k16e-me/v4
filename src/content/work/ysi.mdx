    As one of the largest ethnic groups in Africa, Yoruba used to be a dominant cultural force. However, modern realities such as colonization, geographical bounding, diaspora, and exposure to Western civilization have had Yoruba in a glory less of a shine and strength.

    The Yoruba early cosmogony and devotion to philosophy enabled its value system of mental acuity and advancement, mutual respect, peaceful co-existence, loyalty, and freedom of speech, and drove the people’s development of well-structured, urbanized, and powerful city-states. These city-states were the most populous in Africa in their days as they attracted peoples from all over the world and helped sustain the Yoruba domain.

    Yorubasiti believes it can restore, sustain, and propagate Yoruba through its curations and creations in order to reflect its former glory. K16E’s kb and team have developed a brand identity that not only captures the essence of Yorubasiti but strikes (pun intended) at the heart of what is arguably one of its most played musical instrument — the agogo (double) bell.

    The Yorubasiti project is tapping these bells with varying sonority to all Yoruba all over the world and those who love and want to know or be Yoruba that finally we’ve built the long-awaited instrument to sustain our musically pleasant richly adorned culture.
